    <h1>trollballs</h1>
    <p>Trollballs is a long-running fictional universe created in 2019 by a group of friends, led by Jason (aka JasonManX), and originally went through names like TrollOne and TrollClash before becoming the beloved world of Trollballs. It’s centered around three main characters—Jason, Loopy, and XO—each ruling their own islands: Jasonland, Legends, and Goban Cycyc. These islands are filled with unique and quirky characters like Blowerguy, Guardian (Σ), and Darnel, each with lore, personalities, and sometimes even glitched or corrupted versions like Jsonlang or Crl, born from the terrifying force known as Corrupter (Ȼ). The world includes deep story arcs, tragic battles (like in Era 0 when the sky turned black during the fight with Abomination), resurrection rituals performed by the six universe creators, and a growing list of heroes and villains. Beyond just stories, Trollballs has expanded into games, shorts, and even a developing wiki, bringing humor, horror, glitchy entities, and epic crossovers into one unforgettable universe driven by creativity and chaos</p>
