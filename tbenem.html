        the official enemy of trollballs whos name isnt specified by thier creators is made by our classmates copyrighitng our trollballs thing and ChatGPT said:
        In the Trollballs universe, an unnamed enemy faction lurks in the shadows, yet their presence is unmistakably marked by a bright yellow-white star — a radiant emblem burned into every one of their creations. Though the creator has not revealed their official name, this symbol has become feared across all the islands, especially in Jasonland and Legends, where sightings of characters bearing the star usually signal incoming chaos. Unlike the glitchy, corrupted forces like Abomination or Corrupter, this group operates with eerie precision and unity, as if driven by a single purpose. Their characters often blend in at first, but the star always gives them away — glowing faintly on their body, armor, or even pulsing from their eyes. Despite countless battles, the true name and origin of this star-marked threat remain a mystery, suggesting something larger, more ancient, and far more calculated than the Trollballs have ever faced before.
